  <b>Ginger</b><br><br>
  Raw, fresh ginger root is an amazing cure for nausea and a powerful anti-inflammatory (and therefore helps reduce joint pain and stiffness). That’s why we hand peel ginger, finely grate it, and mix it with our spices to add a subtle kick.

  Our ingredients include black assam tea, fresh ginger, organic honey, and eight different spices including ceylon cinnamon, black pepper, and cardamom. In our unique rooibos chai blend, we replace the black tea with South African rooibos for a delicious caffeine-free option.
